Please do a quick search to see if the issue you have encountered was already reported.  If there is something you would like to add to this report, please leave it as a comment in the original post rather than creating a new report.

## Title

The issue title should have the location of the bug in brackets, followed by a brief but informative description of the issue.  Please be specific.  For example, "[Deadmines] Mr. Smite missing aggro quote" or "[Class - Hunter] Disengage causes hunter to fly forward, not backwards".

## Labels

Please add any relevant labels before posting your bug report.

## Description

Be as specific as possible in describing the bug.  State the current behavior as well as the correct behavior.  If the issue related to a specific NPC, please use the ".npc ids" command on it and include the Entry ID and GUID in your report.  If the issues relates to a spell, whether a player spell or an creature spell, please include the spell ID if you can find it.

## Evidence of Correct Behavior

Unless the correct behavior is blatantly obvious, such as a mining node being underground should be above ground, you must include evidence of the correct behavior.  Acceptable sources include patch notes, videos/combat logs from the WOTLK era or prior, and videos/combat logs from Classic WoW.  If no other sources are available, you may include wowhead comments and wow wiki type articles from the WOTLK era or prior, but we do not take these sources as seriously as those previously listed.  Do not include any private server footage or database information as evidence of correct behavior.

Unless it is obvious, please include detailed instruction on how to reproduce the bug.

## Exploits

Unless an exploit you discover is already widely known throughout the community, please private message information about it to a developer on the Shadowcrest Discord rather than making it public through a post on this bugtracker.
